        Getlabs provides a technology platform that allows customers to schedule blood draws with mobile phlebotomists for the purpose of fulfilling customer lab orders and delivering their blood samples to a diagnostic laboratory. When a blood collectioin appointment is created through our Services, a mobile phlebotomist will travel to customer and perform the applicable venipuncture procedure at the scheduled time and location. We require every phlebotomist to have the requisite license, certification, training, experience, and equipment to provide such professional venipuncture services. The phlebotomists are independent contractors who are not our employees, agents or representatives.

You and Getlabs agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Getlabs are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

        As limited exceptions to Section 14(a) above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, <span class="h-dark-text-color h-bold-font-weight">you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute</span> if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at <a href="mailto:hello@getlabs.com" class="h-link">hello@getlabs.com</a> or by regular mail at 1725 Ocean Front Walk, #710, Santa Monica, CA 90401 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.

        (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules
      </h3>
      <p class="h-medium-l-b2 h-mb-20">
        The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="h-dark-text-color h-bold-font-weight">AAA</span>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<span class="h-dark-text-color h-bold-font-weight">AAA Rules</span>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" class="h-link">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" class="h-link">www.adr.org</a>.
        <br><br>
        If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

      </h3>
      <p class="h-medium-l-b2 h-mb-20">
        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

        <span class="h-dark-text-color h-bold-font-weight">YOU AND GETLABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</span>. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

        (f) Effect of Changes on Arbitration
      </h3>
      <p class="h-medium-l-b2 h-mb-20">
        Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 “Changes to Terms or Services” above, if Getlabs changes any of the terms of this Section 14 “Dispute Resolution” after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:hello@getlabs.com" class="h-link">hello@getlabs.com</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Getlabs’s email to you notifying you of such change.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Getlabs’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Getlabs may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

      </h3>
      <p class="h-medium-l-b2">

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Getlabs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
